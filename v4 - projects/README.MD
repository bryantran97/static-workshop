# Here we start working on the PROJECTS
Here we will be learning more about bootstrap's gridding system. We work with creating projects with images and text. The first project is your main project so it's the most showcased and will be filling the whole page, while your other two projects are side by side.

What you will learn
* more div stuff
* bootstrap's 12 grid system
* background color changing
* image resizing in browser
* figure tag
* more small css-stylings
