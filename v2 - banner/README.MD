# Here we start working on the BANNER
This banner is just for aesthetics. We include a photoshopped image with a transparent background. Here we will be placing that inside of a section and creating a whole section that is turned blue. The image will be responsive and resize with the browser.


What you will learn
* img tag
* figure tag
* background color changing
* image resizing to fit browser
